Elasticsearch: This is an open source, distributed, RESTful, JSON-based search engine. It is scalable, easy to use, and flexible
Logstash : This is a server‑side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a “stash” like Elasticsearch.
Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.
For RHEL 8, refer to:

How to Install ELK Stack on RHEL / CentOS 8

Please follow our steps below to install and configure ELK stack tools on CentOS 7 / Fedora 31/30/29 Linux.


Step 1: Install Java
As Elasticsearch depends on Java, you need to install Java on your CentOS 7 / Fedora system.

sudo yum -y install java-openjdk-devel java-openjdk
Step 2: Add ELK repository
Once you have Java installed, add ELK stack repository which provides ELK stack packages.

For Elasticsearch 7.x

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo
[elasticsearch-7.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 7.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
EOF
For Elasticsearch 6.x

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo
[elasticsearch-6.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 6.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
EOF
After adding the repo, import GPG key:

sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
Clear and update your YUM package index.

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum makecache
Step 3: Install and Configure Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch repository is ready for use. You can install Elasticsearch using the command below:

sudo yum -y install elasticsearch
Confirm package installation.


$ rpm -qi elasticsearch

 Summary     : Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud. Reference documentation can be found at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html and the 'Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide' book can be found at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html
 Description :
 Elasticsearch subproject :distribution:packages
You can set JVM options like memory limits by editing the file: /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options

Example below sets initial/maximum size of total heap space

-Xms1g
-Xmx1g
If your system has less memory, you can configure it to use small megabytes of ram.

-Xms256m
-Xmx512m
Start and enable elasticsearch service on boot:

$ sudo systemctl enable --now elasticsearch.service 
 Synchronizing state of elasticsearch.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
 Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable elasticsearch
 Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/elasticsearch.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.

Test to verify that it is working:

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9200 
 {
   "name" : "bBzN5Kg",
   "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
   "cluster_uuid" : "LKyqXXSvRvCpX9QAwKlP2Q",
   "version" : {
     "number" : "6.5.4",
     "build_flavor" : "default",
     "build_type" : "rpm",
     "build_hash" : "d2ef93d",
     "build_date" : "2018-12-17T21:17:40.758843Z",
     "build_snapshot" : false,
     "lucene_version" : "7.5.0",
     "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
     "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
   },
   "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
 }
Create a test index:

$ curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:9200/mytest_index"
{"acknowledged":true,"shards_acknowledged":true,"index":"mytest_index"}
Step 4: Install and Configure Kibana
Download and install Kibana from the added Elasticsearch repository.

sudo yum -y install kibana
After a successful installation, configure Kibana:

$ sudo vim /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
server.host: "0.0.0.0"
server.name: "kibana.example.com"
elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9200"
Change other settings as desired then start kibana service:

sudo systemctl enable --now kibana

Access http://ip-address:5601 to open Kibana Dashboard:

elasticsearch kibana centos7 min
If you have an active firewall service, allow TCP port 5601

sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5601/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Step 5: Install and Configure Logstash
The last installation is for Logstash. It will act as a centralized logs server for your client systems which runs an agent like filebeat.

sudo yum -y install logstash
Logstash custom configurations can be placed under the /etc/logstash/conf.d/directory.

Check Logstash Configuration manual for more details.

Step 6: Install other ELK tools – Bonus
Other ELK tools that can be installed include:


Filebeat: Lightweight Shipper for Logs. It helps you keep the simple things simple by offering a lightweight way to forward and centralize logs and files
Metricbeat: Collect metrics from your systems and services. From CPU to memory, Redis to NGINX, and much more, Metricbeat is a lightweight way to send system and service statistics.
Packetbeat: Lightweight Shipper for Network Data
Heartbeat: Lightweight Shipper for Uptime Monitoring. It helps you monitor services for their availability with active probing
Auditbeat: Lightweight shipper that helps you audit the activities of users and processes on your systems
These tools can be installed with yum package manager using their respective names. The example below will install all ELK addon tools.

sudo yum install filebeat auditbeat metricbeat packetbeat heartbeat-elastic
